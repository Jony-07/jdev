                My name is Jony Morales and I'm twenty-two years old. I'm from
                El Salvador and currently, I'm final year computer science engineering student. <p></p>
                I have worked with some technologies during my time at the University, but in some of them I learned more than in others ones.

                I'm open to learn new technologies, but I have done my social hours as internships in web development.
                Also, I obtained certificates with ASP.net in udemy and Java Fundamentals in oracle. In addition, I took the TOELF exam and I scored B2 - 502 pts.
